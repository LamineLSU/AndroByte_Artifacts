    "Summary": "This method originates a device ID by calling TelephonyManager.getDeviceId(). It then displays a Toast message with the device ID and logs a verbose message using Log.v. The device ID is retrieved from the TelephonyManager and used to create a Toast message. The method does not pass the device ID to any other methods, and does not reach any sinks. Therefore, the Next Methods list is empty.",
