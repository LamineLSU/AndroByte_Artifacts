Processed summary for Ljunbin/ubc/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "This method originates user data by calling `TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()`. This API retrieves the device's unique ID, which is then used to create an HTTP POST request using Apache HttpClient. The device ID is passed as the content of the POST request. This method does not appear to have any sinks directly within itself, but it initiates a network transmission which could be a sink.  The `Next Methods` list reflects the invoked methods in this chain.",
