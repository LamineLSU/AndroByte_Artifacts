Sensitive method found: Llina/ubc/eventorderingtest/ActivityWithFlow;->assignSensitivityInfo:()V
Processed summary for Llina/ubc/eventorderingtest/ActivityWithFlow;->assignSensitivityInfo:()V: {
    "Summary": "The method `assignSensitivityInfo` originates user data by calling `getSystemService` on an `android.telephony.TelephonyManager` to obtain the device ID using `getDeviceId()`. This device ID is then stored as a static field `deviceId` within the `Llina/ubc/eventorderingtest/ActivityWithFlow` class.  No sinks were identified in this method, and the sensitive data is only propagated internally within the class. Therefore, no external data transmission or storage is observed.",
