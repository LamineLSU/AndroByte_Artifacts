        "Ljunbin/ubc/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "This method originates user data by calling `TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()`. This retrieves the device ID, a sensitive piece of information. The device ID is then stored in the `MainActivity.c` field as a `Class` object. Subsequently, a `reflect.Method` is invoked to call a method named \"leak\" on the `MainActivity.o` field.  Because the method ultimately calls a reflection method, it's considered a sink. Therefore, the `Next Methods` list is empty."
