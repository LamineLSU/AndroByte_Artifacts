This method then uses the SmsManager to send an SMS message with the device ID (+1 1234). The data originates from the device ID and is propagated through the SmsManager. The method then logs this activity using Log.i.  Because the method sends an SMS message, it is a sink. Therefore, the Next Methods list is empty."
