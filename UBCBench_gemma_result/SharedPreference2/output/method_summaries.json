        "Llina/ubc/sharedpreference2/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "This method originates user data by obtaining the device ID using the TelephonyManager's getDeviceId() method. Specifically, it retrieves the device ID (likely IMEI) and stores it in a SharedPreferences file named 'imei'. The device ID is obtained via the `android.telephony.TelephonyManager` class, which is a sensitive API. The data is then stored in SharedPreferences, which is a common mechanism for persisting user preferences. The method also sets the application's UI and registers a listener for shared preferences changes. Because this method uses a sensitive API to obtain the device ID, it is considered a sink."
