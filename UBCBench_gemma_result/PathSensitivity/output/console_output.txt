Processed summary for Llina/ubc/pathsensitivity/PathSensitivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "This method, `PathSensitivity->onCreate`, originates user data by calling `TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()`. This method retrieves the device ID, which is a sensitive piece of user data. The device ID is obtained via the TelephonyManager, a system service. The device ID is then logged using `android.util.Log.i`. Because this method directly calls a sensitive API and logs the result, it constitutes a sink. Therefore, the 'Next Methods' list is empty.",
