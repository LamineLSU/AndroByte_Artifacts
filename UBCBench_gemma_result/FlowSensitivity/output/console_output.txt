Processed summary for Llina/ubc/flowsensitivity/FlowSensitivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "This method's `onCreate` method first calls the superclass's `onCreate` method. Then, it sets the content view using `setContentView`. Critically, it obtains the device ID using `getDeviceId()` from a `TelephonyManager`. This is a sensitive operation as it retrieves device identification information. The device ID is then logged using `Log.e`, and subsequently logged again with a different message. Because the device ID is logged, this represents a sink. Therefore, no further methods are invoked.",
