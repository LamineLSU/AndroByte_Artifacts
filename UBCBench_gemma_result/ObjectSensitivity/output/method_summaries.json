        "Llina/ubc/objectsensitivity/ObjectSensitivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "This method's `onCreate` method initializes a LinkedList, retrieves the device ID using `TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()`, and logs two strings to the logcat. The device ID ('123') is obtained via the `TelephonyManager` and added to the LinkedList. The method then logs 'ObjectSensitivity1' and 'ObjectSensitivity2' to the logcat.  The primary sensitive data operation is the retrieval of the device ID via the `TelephonyManager`. This is a potential sink as it exposes device identification information."
