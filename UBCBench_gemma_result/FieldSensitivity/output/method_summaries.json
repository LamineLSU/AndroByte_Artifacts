        "Llina/ubc/fieldsensitivity/FieldSensitivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "This method originates user data by obtaining the device ID using the `getDeviceId()` method of the `TelephonyManager` class. Specifically, it retrieves the device ID as a string and stores it in the `info1` and `info2` fields of the `FieldSensitivity$A` object. This data is then logged using `android.util.Log.e`, which constitutes a sink. Therefore, the device ID is ultimately logged to the system log."
