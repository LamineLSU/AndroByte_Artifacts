        "Ljunbin/ubc/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "This method originates user data by obtaining the device ID using the `getDeviceId()` method of the `TelephonyManager`. Specifically, it uses the `android.telephony.TelephonyManager` to retrieve the device ID, which is then stored in the `v2` register. The device ID is a string 'junbin.ubc.MainActivity'. The method then uses reflection to invoke a custom method named 'leak' with the device ID as an argument.  No sinks are identified in this method."
