Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ljunbin/ubc/MainActivity;->buttonClick:(Landroid/view/View;)V']
[SUMMARY] Ljunbin/ubc/MainActivity;->buttonClick:(Landroid/view/View;)V => The method retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager obtained through getSystemService using the 'phone' key, which can be considered sensitive information. This device ID is then logged via Log.v with a tag 'TAG'. The device ID itself is not directly passed to another method or stored in a way that would compromise privacy without explicit consent and proper handling as per data protection regulations.
