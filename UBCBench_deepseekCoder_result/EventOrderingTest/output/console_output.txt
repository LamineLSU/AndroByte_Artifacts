Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Llina/ubc/eventorderingtest/ActivityWithFlow;->assignSensitivityInfo:()V']
[SUMMARY] Llina/ubc/eventorderingtest/ActivityWithFlow;->assignSensitivityInfo:()V => This method retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager system service, which can be considered sensitive information as it uniquely identifies the mobile device. The retrieved device ID is then stored in a class variable named 'deviceId'.
[SUMMARY] Llina/ubc/eventorderingtest/ActivityWithFlow;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method does not originate or store user personal data. It retrieves and logs the device ID which might be considered sensitive, but since it's just being logged without any further processing or passing to other methods, there is no direct risk of leaking this information.
