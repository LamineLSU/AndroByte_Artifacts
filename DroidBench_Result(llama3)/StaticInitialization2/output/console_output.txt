Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity$StaticInitClass1;-><clinit>:()V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity$StaticInitClass1;-><clinit>:()V => This method originates user data by obtaining the device ID from the TelephonyManager. Specifically, it uses `getSystemService(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;` to access the TelephonyManager, then calls `getDeviceId()`, which returns a string representing the device ID. This device ID is then stored as a static field `im` within the `MainActivity` class.  This process directly involves accessing and storing potentially sensitive user data (device ID) within the application.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => This method initiates the sending of an SMS message containing the string "+49 1234" to an unknown recipient. This directly involves the transmission of a potentially sensitive string (phone number) as part of an SMS message. The method utilizes `SmsManager` which is a core Android component for SMS communication, increasing the risk of data leakage if not handled carefully. The method itself doesn't explicitly sanitize or mask the data before sending, making it a potential data leakage point.
