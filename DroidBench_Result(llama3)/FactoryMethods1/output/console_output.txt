Processed summary for Lde/ecspride/FactoryMethods1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "The method Lde/ecspride/FactoryMethods1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V originates user personal data by calling sensitive APIs to get location information. The data is stored in registers v0 (Criteria) and v1 (Location). The location data is then passed to the `getBestProvider` method, which returns a string representing the best provider for location services. This string is used as an argument to the `getLastKnownLocation` method, which returns a Location object containing the user's last known latitude and longitude. The sensitive data (location) reaches a sink point, which is the logging operation.",
