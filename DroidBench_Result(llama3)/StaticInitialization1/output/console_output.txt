Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => This method initiates the lifecycle of the MainActivity. Critically, it retrieves the device ID using `TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()`, storing it as a static field `MainActivity.im`. This represents the origin of user personal data. The `TelephonyManager` itself is a potential sink, as it exposes device identifiers, which are considered personal data.  The `MainActivity.im` field then stores this data, making it accessible throughout the application's lifecycle.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity$StaticInitClass1;-><clinit>:()V => This method initiates the sending of an SMS message containing the phone number "+49 1234". The method directly uses `SmsManager` to send this message. This represents a significant risk as it involves transmitting a phone number, which is considered personal data. The phone number is hardcoded into the application, making it a potential source of sensitive data. The method does not perform any sanitization or validation of the phone number before sending it, further increasing the risk.
