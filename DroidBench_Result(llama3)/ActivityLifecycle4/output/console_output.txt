Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onResume:()V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onResume:()V => The method `onResume` originates user personal data by obtaining the device ID using `getSystemService(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Object;` which accesses the TelephonyManager. This TelephonyManager is used to retrieve the device ID (`getDeviceId()`). This device ID, a form of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), is then stored within the `MainActivity` object itself, specifically in the `imei` field. This represents a potential data leak as the device ID is stored persistently within the application.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onPause:()V => This method initiates the sending of an SMS message containing the Imei (+49 1234) via the SmsManager. This directly involves the collection and transmission of a potentially sensitive data point (IMEI) which is a unique identifier associated with the device. The Imei is retrieved from the `imei` field of the `MainActivity` class. The SMS sending operation itself is a potential data leak if the Imei is not properly sanitized or handled. The method does not appear to sanitize or filter the Imei before sending.
