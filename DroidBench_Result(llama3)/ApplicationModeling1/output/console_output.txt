Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/application_modeling/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/application_modeling/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => This method originates user device ID data by calling `getDeviceId()` on a `TelephonyManager`. This data is then stored as `imei` within a `MyApplication` instance. The method then creates a new intent to launch `AnotherActivity`.  The `TelephonyManager` object, which contains the device ID, is a potential sink for sensitive data.
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/application_modeling/AnotherActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method `onCreate` initiates the lifecycle of `AnotherActivity`. It first calls the parent class's `onCreate` method. Then, it sets the layout using `setContentView`. It retrieves the `imei` from a `MyApplication` instance. Critically, it logs this `imei` string to the logcat using `Log.i`. This logging of the `imei` constitutes a real sink for sensitive data.
