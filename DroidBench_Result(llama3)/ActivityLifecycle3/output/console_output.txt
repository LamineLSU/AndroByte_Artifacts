Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onSaveInstanceState:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onSaveInstanceState:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => This method retrieves the subscriber ID from the device's TelephonyManager. The `getSystemService` call obtains an instance of `TelephonyManager`. The `getSubscriberId()` method then extracts a string, which is stored as a field `s` within the `MainActivity` object. This directly exposes the subscriber ID, a potentially sensitive piece of personal data, to the application's state.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onRestoreInstanceState:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => This method `onRestoreInstanceState` initiates the sending of an SMS message containing the phone number "+49 1234" to an unknown recipient. This directly involves the transmission of personal data (phone number) via the `SmsManager`. The method itself does not perform any further data processing or storage of this data beyond the SMS sending operation. The use of `SmsManager` indicates a potential data leak if the SMS message is not handled securely, as it exposes the phone number to external services.
