Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/service_lifecycle/MyService;->onStartCommand:(Landroid/content/Intent; I I)I']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/service_lifecycle/MyService;->onStartCommand:(Landroid/content/Intent; I I)I => This method originates user data by obtaining the device ID using `getDeviceId()` from the `TelephonyManager`. This device ID, a unique identifier, is then stored within the `value` field of the `MyService` object. Critically, the `Log.i()` call logs the device ID to logcat, which constitutes a real sink for sensitive data. Therefore, the device ID is originated, stored, and passed to a real sink via logging.
