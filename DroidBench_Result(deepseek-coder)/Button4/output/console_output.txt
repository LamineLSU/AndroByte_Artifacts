Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/Button4;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/Button4;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => In the provided method, user personal data (specifically, the IMEI of the device) is originated and stored in the class variable 'imei'. The method retrieves the TelephonyManager service using the system service 'phone', then calls getDeviceId() to obtain the IMEI. This IMEI is subsequently stored in a static field named 'imei' within the same class.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/Button4;->sendMessage:(Landroid/view/View;)V => The method sends an SMS with the IMEI number of the device as its content to a predefined phone number. The IMEI number, which is considered sensitive information, is sourced from a class variable and passed to methods that handle SMS sending.
