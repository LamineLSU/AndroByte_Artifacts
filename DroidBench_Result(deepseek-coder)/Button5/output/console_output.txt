Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/button_object_allocation/Button1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/button_object_allocation/Button1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager using getDeviceId(), which represents user-specific information, and stores this in a static variable called imei within the class. This indicates that sensitive user personal data (IMEI) is originated, stored, and passed internally within the application.
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/button_object_allocation/Button1;->sendMessage:(Landroid/view/View;)V => The method involves retrieving the hint from a Button and logging it using Log.i(). The button's hint, which could contain user-specific information, is retrieved and then logged via Log.i(), potentially exposing this information to logs.
