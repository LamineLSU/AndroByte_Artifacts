Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/string_to_char/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/string_to_char/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager using getDeviceId(), which represents user-specific information such as the unique identifier for the mobile phone device. This data is then processed by converting each character of the device ID into a character array, and finally, it logs this potentially sensitive information to the logcat with Log.i(...) if its length is greater than zero.
