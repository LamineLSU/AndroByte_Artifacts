Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/OverwiteValue;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/OverwiteValue;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method 'onCreate' in the class 'OverwiteValue' retrieves user-specific information including device ID and stores it in an instance of 'DataStore'. It then uses this data to send SMS messages with the phone number and a custom message containing placeholders for later replacement. The device ID is directly stored in the DataStore object, which could be considered as originating sensitive data from the user's device.
