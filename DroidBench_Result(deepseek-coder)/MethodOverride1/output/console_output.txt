Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MethodOverride1;->attachBaseContext:(Landroid/content/Context;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MethodOverride1;->attachBaseContext:(Landroid/content/Context;)V => The method retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager obtained via getSystemService('phone'), which is sensitive information typically associated with user privacy, and then logs this device ID using Log.d(), which can be considered a real sink if it involves logging tainted data.
