Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/VirtualDispatch1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/VirtualDispatch1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => In the method onCreate of Lde/ecspride/VirtualDispatch1, user personal data (IMEI) is originated from the TelephonyManager's getDeviceId() call and stored in an instance variable imei.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/VirtualDispatch1;->clickButton:(Landroid/view/View;)V => The method increments a counter and checks its parity. If the counter is even, it initializes an instance of Lde/ecspride/NoDataLeak with the message 'no leak' and calls logData(). If the counter is odd, it initializes another instance of Lde/ecspride/DataLeak using the device's IMEI which is stored in a field, also calling logData() on the new instance. The method does not involve any direct interactions with user personal data or transmit it to external entities.
