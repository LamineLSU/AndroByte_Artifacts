Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity$StaticInitClass1;-><clinit>:()V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity$StaticInitClass1;-><clinit>:()V => The method retrieves the device ID from the system service TelephonyManager, which is obtained through the context of the application. The retrieved device ID is then stored in a static field of MainActivity as a sensitive piece of information.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method 'onCreate' in 'de/ecspride/MainActivity' initializes the activity, sets its content view to a predefined resource ID, and sends an SMS message containing a hardcoded phone number. The sensitive data being processed is the phone number '+49 1234', which is directly used in the 'sendTextMessage' method call without any sanitization or encryption.
