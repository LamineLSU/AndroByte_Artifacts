Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/clinit/Test;-><clinit>:()V']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/clinit/Test;-><clinit>:()V => The method retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager service provided by Android, which can be considered sensitive information as it uniquely identifies the mobile device. This information is then stored in an instance variable of MainActivity.
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/clinit/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method onCreate in MainActivity initializes the main activity by setting its content view to a predefined resource ID, 2130903040, and retrieves a string from an instance variable named 's'. It then logs this string along with a constant string 'DroidBench' using Log.i. The method does not involve any direct interaction with user personal data beyond the initialization of the content view.
