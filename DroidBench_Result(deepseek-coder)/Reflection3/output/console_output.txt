[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method 'onCreate' in 'de.ecspride.MainActivity' involves the retrieval and manipulation of device ID from TelephonyManager, which is considered sensitive information. This data is used to set an IMEI through reflection and then passed to a custom class for further processing. Additionally, it attempts to send a text message with a hardcoded phone number prefixed with a German country code, potentially involving user personal data.
