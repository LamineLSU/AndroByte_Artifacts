Processed summary for Lde/ecspride/Exceptions4;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "In the method onCreate of class de.ecspride.Exceptions4, user personal data is originated from the device ID obtained through Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager. The device ID is stored in register v7 and then used to create a new instance of Ljava/lang/RuntimeException with this ID as its message. This exception is thrown, but during this process, the method also attempts to send an SMS message containing the exception's message (the device ID) via Landroid/telephony/SmsManager. However, no sensitive data is stored or passed to other methods beyond this point.",
