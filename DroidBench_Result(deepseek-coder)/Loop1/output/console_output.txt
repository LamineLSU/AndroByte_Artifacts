Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/LoopExample1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/LoopExample1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager using getDeviceId(), which represents user-specific information, and then constructs a new string by appending an underscore to each character of the device ID. This process does not directly pass or store sensitive data in a way that could be considered a real sink without further processing.
