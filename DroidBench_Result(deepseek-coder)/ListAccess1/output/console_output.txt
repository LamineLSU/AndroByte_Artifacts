Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/ListAccess1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/ListAccess1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method initializes a list and adds several strings to it, including 'not tainted', 'phone' which results in fetching the device ID from the TelephonyManager, and 'neutral text'. It then retrieves the default SMS manager and attempts to send an SMS message with one of the strings from the list as the phone number. The device ID is considered sensitive data.
