Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/ContentProvider;->onCreate:()Z']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/ContentProvider;->onCreate:()Z => The method retrieves the device ID (IMEI) from the TelephonyManager associated with the context of the ContentProvider, which is then stored in a static field of the ApplicationLifecyle3 class.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/ApplicationLifecyle3;->onCreate:()V => The method sends an SMS message containing the IMEI of the device to a predefined number using the SmsManager, which involves accessing and transmitting user-specific information (IMEI) without proper consent or necessary permissions.
