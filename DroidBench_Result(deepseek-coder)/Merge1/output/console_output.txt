Processed summary for Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->aliasFlowTest:()V: {
    "Summary": "In the method aliasFlowTest(), sensitive data is originated from the device ID obtained through Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager;. This data is stored in the register v8 and then passed to instances of Lde/ecspride/MainActivity$A; one such instance is created and its field b is set with the device ID. Subsequently, this data is used to send an SMS message via Landroid/telephony/SmsManager;, which could potentially be a sink if not properly handled. However, no explicit logging or network transmission operations are observed in this method.",
