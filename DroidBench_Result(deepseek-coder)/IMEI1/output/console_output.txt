Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method retrieves the device ID from TelephonyManager and constructs a new string by appending 'secret' to it, then logs this modified string using Log.d with tag 'DROIDBENCH'. Additionally, it attempts to send an SMS but does not specify which data is being sent.
