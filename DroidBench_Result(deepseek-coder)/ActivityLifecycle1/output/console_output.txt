Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/ActivityLifecycle1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/ActivityLifecycle1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method onCreate extracts the device ID from TelephonyManager and concatenates it with a hardcoded string to form a URL, which is then stored in a static field. The sensitive information (device ID) is originated, processed, and stored within this method.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/ActivityLifecycle1;->connect:()V => The method connects to a URL specified in the class variable 'URL' of the same Activity (Lde/ecspride/ActivityLifecycle1). It creates an HttpURLConnection, sets the request method to GET, and initiates the connection. The sensitive data being accessed or passed here is the URL which might contain user-specific information.
