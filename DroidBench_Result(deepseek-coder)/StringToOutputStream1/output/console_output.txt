[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/outputstream/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => In the given method, sensitive user personal data (specifically, the device ID obtained from TelephonyManager) is originated and stored as bytes in a ByteArrayOutputStream before being logged using Log.i(...). The device ID is retrieved from the TelephonyManager instance and then converted to a byte array.
