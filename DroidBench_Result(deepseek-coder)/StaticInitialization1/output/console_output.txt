Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => In the given method, sensitive user personal data (specifically, the device ID obtained from TelephonyManager) is originated and stored within the MainActivity instance. The device ID is retrieved using the getDeviceId() method of TelephonyManager, which directly accesses hardware-specific information about the device. This data is then stored in a static field named 'im' within the MainActivity class.
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity$StaticInitClass1;-><clinit>:()V => The method sends an SMS message containing the phone number '+49 1234'. This involves accessing and using user-provided phone numbers, which can be considered sensitive personal information.
