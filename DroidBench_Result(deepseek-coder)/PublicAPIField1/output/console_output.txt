Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/public_api_field/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/public_api_field/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method retrieves the device ID from TelephonyManager and converts parts of it to float values, which are then used to create a new instance of Android's PointF class. The IMEI (using part of the device ID) is logged via Log.i(), potentially exposing sensitive information.
