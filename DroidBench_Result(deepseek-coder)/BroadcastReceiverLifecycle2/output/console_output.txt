[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => In the method onCreate of de/ecspride/MainActivity, sensitive data such as the device ID obtained from TelephonyManager is processed and potentially exposed. The device ID is used to create a BroadcastReceiver instance with this information, which could be considered sensitive if not handled securely.
