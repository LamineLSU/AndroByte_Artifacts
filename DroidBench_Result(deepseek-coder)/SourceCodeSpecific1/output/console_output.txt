Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method 'onCreate' in the class 'MainActivity' of the app 'ecspride' involves handling user personal data by obtaining and manipulating phone numbers stored in a set, which are later used to send SMS messages. The TelephonyManager is utilized to get the device ID, but this does not involve direct user personal data unless explicitly defined or required for the service.
