Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/serialization/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/serialization/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The method 'onCreate' in the class 'MainActivity' of the app 'serialization' retrieves the device ID from the TelephonyManager using the system service 'phone', which is obtained by calling getSystemService with the argument 'phone'. This device ID is then used to create an instance of a custom class 'S' and serialized into a byte array. The serialized data, which contains the potentially sensitive information (device ID), is then deserialized back into an object. Throughout this process, including logging it via Log.i, there is a clear flow of user personal data from the TelephonyManager to the custom class 'S', and ultimately to be logged or stored in some form.
