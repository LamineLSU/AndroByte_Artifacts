Then, it obtains the device ID using `getDeviceId` from `TelephonyManager`.  Following this, it attempts to send a text message with the device ID as the message body via `SmsManager.sendTextMessage`. The device ID is passed as the `vDest` argument to this sink.  The `vText` argument is tainted because it's the value of `v3` (the device ID)."
