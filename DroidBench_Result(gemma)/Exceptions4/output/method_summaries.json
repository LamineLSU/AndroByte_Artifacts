        "Lde/ecspride/Exceptions4;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The method `Lde/ecspride/Exceptions4;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V` first calls `invoke-super`, which is a standard activity lifecycle method and does not involve any sensitive data. Then, it calls `setContentView` with an integer constant. Next, it calls `getSystemService` with the string \"phone\", which invokes `android.telephony.TelephonyManager->getDeviceId()`. This returns a String, which is then used to construct a `RuntimeException`. Finally, it attempts to send a text message using `SmsManager.sendTextMessage` with the phone number \"+49 1234\" as the destination address and the message body. This is a clear flow of sensitive data from `getDeviceId` to `SmsManager.sendTextMessage`. The `getDeviceId` call is the source, and the `sendTextMessage` call is the sink. The `+49 1234` is the argument to the sink."
