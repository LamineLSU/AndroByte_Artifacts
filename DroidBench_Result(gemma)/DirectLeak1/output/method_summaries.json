        "Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method of `MainActivity` first calls `invoke-super`, which is a standard activity lifecycle method and does not involve sensitive data. Then, `const-string v1, \"phone\"` creates a string literal. Subsequently, `invoke-virtual v6, Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager;->getDeviceId()Ljava/lang/String;` calls the `getDeviceId` method, which is a sensitive API. The result is stored in `v6` and then used as an argument to `SmsManager.sendTextMessage`. This demonstrates a flow from `getDeviceId` to `sendTextMessage`. Specifically, the `vText` argument to `sendTextMessage` is tainted with the device ID. The `const/4 v5, 2` instruction sets the value of `v5` to 2, and the subsequent `move-object v3, v5` instruction moves the value of `v5` to `v3`. The `iget-object v4, vInstance, LFoo;->bar:Ljava/lang/String;` instruction retrieves the value of `v3` and assigns it to `v4`. The `aget-object vT, vArr, vIdx` instruction retrieves the value of `v4` and assigns it to `vT` when `vIdx` is 2.  This confirms that `vT` holds the device ID. Finally, the `sendTextMessage` method is called with the tainted device ID as the message body, completing the flow."
