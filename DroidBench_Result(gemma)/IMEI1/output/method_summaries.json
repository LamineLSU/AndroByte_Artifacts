        "Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The method `onCreate` first calls `getSystemService` which invokes `getDeviceId()`. This instruction directly utilizes the `getDeviceId()` API, a sensitive source. The returned device ID is then used as an argument to `sendTextMessage` via `SmsManager.sendTextMessage`. The `vText` argument, which is the message body, is tainted by this flow. Therefore, a leak is identified due to the direct passage of the device ID into the `sendTextMessage` sink. `Next Methods` is set to `[]` because a sink was identified and triggered."
