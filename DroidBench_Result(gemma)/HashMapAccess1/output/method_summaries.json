It then stores this device ID in a `HashMap` under the keys \"tainted\" and \"untainted\". Finally, it uses the `SmsManager` to send an SMS message with the device ID \"+49 1234\". This represents a clear data leakage point as it directly transmits sensitive device information. The device ID is stored in a HashMap, which is a potential storage sink. The final SMS sending operation is a direct transmission of the device ID, making it a significant sink."
