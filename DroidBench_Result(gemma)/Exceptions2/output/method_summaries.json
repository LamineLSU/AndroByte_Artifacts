        "Lde/ecspride/Exceptions2;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The method `Lde/ecspride/Exceptions2;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V` first calls `invoke-super`, which is a standard activity lifecycle method and doesn't involve sensitive data. Then, it calls `setContentView` with an integer constant. Next, it calls `getSystemService` with the string \"phone\", retrieving a `TelephonyManager` instance. Crucially, it then calls `getDeviceId()`, which returns a string representing the device ID. This string is then used as an argument to `SmsManager.sendTextMessage`, passing the device ID as the message body.  This constitutes a leak because the device ID, a sensitive piece of information, is explicitly passed to a sink function (`sendTextMessage`). The `SmsManager.sendTextMessage` call is the sink."
