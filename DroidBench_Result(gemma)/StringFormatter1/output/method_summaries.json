        "Ledu/mit/string_formatter/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method of `MainActivity` first invokes the superclass constructor. Then, it calls `getSystemService` to obtain a `TelephonyManager` instance.  The `getDeviceId()` method is called on this instance, which is a sensitive API. The result of `getDeviceId()` (a String) is then used to initialize a `StringBuffer`, and subsequently used in a `Log.i` call. The `Log.i` call is a sink.  The flow is: `[TelephonyManager.getDeviceId() -> StringBuffer -> Log.i]`.  The `Log.i` sink is triggered by the tainted `getDeviceId()` result. The `Log.i` call is the sink."
