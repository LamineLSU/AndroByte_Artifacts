        "Lde/ecspride/VirtualDispatch1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The method `Lde/ecspride/VirtualDispatch1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V` first invokes the superclass constructor (`invoke-super`) with the `Bundle` as a parameter. Then, it calls `setContentView` with the constant `2130903040`. Following this, it calls `getSystemService` with the string \"phone\", which triggers the `getDeviceId` method of the `TelephonyManager`. The result of `getDeviceId` (a String) is then stored in the `imei` field of the `VirtualDispatch1` object. This represents a clear flow: `[getDeviceId \u279d String \u279d imei]`. The `getSystemService` call is a sensitive API call, triggering the leak."
