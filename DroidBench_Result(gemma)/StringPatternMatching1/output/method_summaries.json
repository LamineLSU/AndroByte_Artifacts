        "Ledu/mit/pattern_matcher/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method first invokes the superclass constructor. Then, it calls `getSystemService` with \"phone\", retrieving a `TelephonyManager` instance. Subsequently, it calls `getDeviceId()`, which returns a `String`. This `String` is then used as an argument to a regex match, and finally logged with the message \"DroidBench\". The flow is traceable: `getDeviceId()` -> `String` -> `Log.i` (with message \"DroidBench\"). The `getSystemService` call is a sensitive API. The `getDeviceId()` call is a sensitive API. The `Log.i` sink is triggered by the `getDeviceId()` call.  The regex match and `Log.i` are not leaks."
