        "Lde/ecspride/ArrayAccess1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "This method originates user data by obtaining the device ID using the `getDeviceId()` method of the `TelephonyManager` class. Specifically, it uses the `android.telephony.TelephonyManager` to retrieve the device ID. This is then stored in the `arrayData` static field of the `ArrayAccess1` class. The method also sends a text message using the `SmsManager`, further propagating the device ID. The data is not passed to any sinks, and the method returns without logging or network transmission, therefore no sinks are reached."
