Then, `getSystemService` is called with the string \"phone\", which is a standard system service call and does not involve sensitive data. Subsequently, `getDeviceId()` is invoked, which is a sensitive API that retrieves the device ID. The result of `getDeviceId()` is then used to extract a substring and convert it to a float. Finally, the float is used to construct a string, which is then logged using `Log.i`. The flow is traceable: `getDeviceId()` -> `substring()` -> `Float.valueOf()` -> `floatValue()` -> `StringBuilder` -> `Log.i`. This constitutes a clear flow of sensitive data from the `getDeviceId` API to the logging sink."
