        "Ledu/mit/array_copy/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method of `MainActivity` first calls `invoke-super` to initialize the Activity. Then, it sets the content view using `setContentView`. Subsequently, it obtains the device ID using `getDeviceId` from a `TelephonyManager` instance. This `getDeviceId` call is a sensitive API source. The device ID (String) is then copied into a new array using `arraycopy`, and finally logged using `Log.i`. The flow is: `[getDeviceId -> TelephonyManager -> deviceID -> array -> Log.i]`. The `Log.i` sink is triggered by the device ID."
