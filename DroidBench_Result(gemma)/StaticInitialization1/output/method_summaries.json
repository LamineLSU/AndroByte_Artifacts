        "Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method first invokes the superclass constructor. Then, it calls `getSystemService` with the string \"phone\", which retrieves a `TelephonyManager` instance. Subsequently, `getDeviceId()` is called on this `TelephonyManager` instance, and the returned string is stored in the `im` field of the `MainActivity` class. This constitutes a flow: `[getDeviceId() \u279d String \u279d sget-object]`. Specifically, the `getDeviceId()` call is the source, the returned string is the tainted value, and the `sget-object` instruction stores this value into the `im` field."
