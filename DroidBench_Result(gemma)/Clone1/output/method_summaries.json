        "Ledu/mit/clone/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method first calls `invoke-super` to initialize the Activity. Then, it retrieves the device ID using `getDeviceId()` from the `TelephonyManager`. This instruction `invoke-virtual v3, Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager;->getDeviceId()Ljava/lang/String;` directly uses the `getDeviceId()` API, which is a sensitive source. The `getDeviceId()` method returns a `String` value, which is then added to a `LinkedList`. Finally, `Log.i` is called with the device ID as an argument. Therefore, the `Log.i` sink is triggered due to the tainted `v0` (device ID) being passed as an argument.  The instruction `invoke-virtual v3, Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager;->getDeviceId()Ljava/lang/String;` is the key evidence for this leak."
