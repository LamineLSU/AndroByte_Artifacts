        "Ledu/mit/parcel/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method of `MainActivity` first invokes the superclass's `onCreate` method. Then, it calls `getSystemService` with the string \"phone\", obtaining an instance of `TelephonyManager`. Subsequently, it calls `getDeviceId()`, which returns a `String`. Finally, it calls `writeParcel` with the returned `String`. The flow is: `getDeviceId()` (source) \u2192 `v1` (variable) \u2192 `writeParcel` (sink). The `writeParcel` sink is triggered because `v1` holds the result of `getDeviceId()`. This constitutes a leak."
