        "Lde/ecspride/FieldSensitivity4;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "This method originates user data by obtaining the device ID using the TelephonyManager's getDeviceId() method. Specifically, it retrieves the device ID from the Android TelephonyManager and stores it within a Datacontainer object.  It then uses the default SmsManager to send an SMS message containing the device ID (+49 1234).  Because this method directly uses the TelephonyManager and sends an SMS, it represents a potential sink for sensitive data. The method does not invoke any Android or Kotlin libraries, so the filtering rules are adhered to."
