Processed summary for Ledu/mit/non_sink_argument_flow/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "The `onCreate` method first invokes the superclass constructor. Then, it calls `setContentView` with a constant integer value (2130903040). Subsequently, it obtains the device ID using `getDeviceId()` from the `TelephonyManager`. This is a critical flow. The `getDeviceId()` call is a sensitive API. The device ID is then used to instantiate a `ProcessBuilder` which is a potential sink. The `ProcessBuilder` instantiation and subsequent execution is a sink. The `getDeviceId()` call is the source of the sensitive data, and it is passed as an argument to the `ProcessBuilder`. The `ProcessBuilder` instantiation and execution constitutes a sink.
