Processed summary for Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "The `onCreate` method first calls `invoke-super`, which is a standard activity lifecycle method and does not involve sensitive data. Then, it calls `setContentView` with an integer constant, which is a standard UI setup and does not involve sensitive data. Next, it calls `getSystemService` with the string \"phone\", which retrieves a `TelephonyManager` object. The `getDeviceId()` method is then invoked on this `TelephonyManager` object, which is a sensitive API. The result of `getDeviceId()` is a string, which is then written to a file named \"out.txt\" using `openFileOutput` and `write`. This constitutes a clear flow of sensitive data (device ID) into a sink (file writing). The `openFileOutput` and `write` instructions are the key elements in this flow.",
