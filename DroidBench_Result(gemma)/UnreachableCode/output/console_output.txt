Processed summary for Lde/ecspride/UnreachableCode;->unrechable:()V: {
    "Summary": "The method `Lde/ecspride/UnreachableCode;->unrechable:()V` does not contain any sensitive API calls or data flows. It is an unreachable code block and does not interact with any external resources or data. The `invoke-virtual` instruction to `getBaseContext()` and subsequent calls to `getSystemService` and `getDeviceId` are not executed due to the unreachable code. Therefore, no data leakage is detected. The `Log.i` sink is never triggered because `getDeviceId` does not produce a tainted value.",
