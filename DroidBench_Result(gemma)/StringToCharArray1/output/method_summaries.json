        "Ledu/mit/string_to_char/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The method `onCreate` first calls `invoke-super` to initialize the `Activity`. Then, it calls `getSystemService` with `android.telephony.TelephonyManager` to retrieve the device ID using `getDeviceId()`. This instruction directly uses the `getDeviceId()` API, which is a sensitive source. The result of `getDeviceId()` (a string) is then used to populate a `StringBuilder` with the device ID. The `StringBuilder` is then used to log a message using `Log.i`. This creates a flow from `getDeviceId()` (sensitive source) -> `StringBuilder` -> `Log.i` (sink). The `Log.i` sink is triggered by the `String` value returned from `getDeviceId()`. Therefore, a leak is identified."
