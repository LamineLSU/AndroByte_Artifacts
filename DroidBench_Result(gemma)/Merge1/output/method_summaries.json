This `DeviceId` is then used to instantiate a new object `B` and another object `A`.  Subsequently, `SmsManager.sendTextMessage` is invoked, passing the phone number \"+49 1234\" (the destination address) and the device ID (the message body). This constitutes a clear flow from a sensitive API (getDeviceId) to a sensitive sink (sendTextMessage). Therefore, `Next Methods = []`."
