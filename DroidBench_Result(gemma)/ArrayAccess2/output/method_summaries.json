Specifically, it calls TelephonyManager.getDeviceId() to retrieve the device ID string. This string is then stored in a string array and used to send a text message via the SmsManager.  Because this method uses the TelephonyManager to obtain the device ID, it represents a potential source of sensitive user data.  The data is not passed to any other methods in this method, and no sinks are identified within this method itself. Therefore, the 'Next Methods' list remains empty."
