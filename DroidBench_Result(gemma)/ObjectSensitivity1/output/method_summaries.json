        "Lde/ecspride/ObjectSensitivity1;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method first calls `getSystemService` with the string \"phone\", retrieving a `TelephonyManager` instance. Then, `getSimSerialNumber()` is invoked on this `TelephonyManager` instance, retrieving the SIM serial number as a string. This string is added to a `LinkedList`. Subsequently, the string \"123\" is added to the same `LinkedList`. Finally, `SmsManager.sendTextMessage` is called with the string \"+49 1234\" as the destination address, \"123\" as the SMSC address, and the SIM serial number (obtained from `getSimSerialNumber()`) as the message body. The sink `sendTextMessage` is triggered because the message body is the tainted SIM serial number. The register `v1` holds the SIM serial number, which is passed as an argument to `sendTextMessage`. The `v1` register is overwritten with the SIM serial number, so it is no longer tainted."
