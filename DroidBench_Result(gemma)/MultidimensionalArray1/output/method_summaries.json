        "Ledu/mit/array_slice/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method first calls `invoke-super` to initialize the `Activity`. Then, it retrieves the device ID using `getDeviceId` from the `TelephonyManager`. This is achieved through `invoke-virtual v2, Landroid/telephony/TelephonyManager;->getDeviceId()Ljava/lang/String;`. The `getDeviceId` call is the sink. The `TelephonyManager` object is then used to access the `getDeviceId` method. The result of `getDeviceId` is then used to populate an array. Finally, `Log.i` is called with the device ID as the argument. The key evidence for the leak is the `invoke-virtual` call to `getDeviceId` which directly uses a sensitive API.  The `const/4 v5, 1` instruction sets the value of `v5` to 1, and the `const/4 v6, 0` instruction sets the value of `v6` to 0. These constants are used in the subsequent `invoke-virtual` call to `getDeviceId`."
