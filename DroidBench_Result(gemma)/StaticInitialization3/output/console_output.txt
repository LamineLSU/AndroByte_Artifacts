Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Ledu/mit/clinit/Test;-><clinit>:()V']
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/clinit/Test;-><clinit>:()V => This method originates user personal data by obtaining the device ID using `getDeviceId()` from a `TelephonyManager`. This `TelephonyManager` is obtained via `getSystemService()`. The device ID, a string, is then stored in a member variable `s` of the `MainActivity` class.  This represents a potential origin of sensitive data, as device ID is often considered personal information.
[SUMMARY] Ledu/mit/clinit/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V => The `onCreate` method initializes the `MainActivity` object. It calls the superclass constructor, sets the content view, initializes a string variable `s` to "", and creates an instance of `Test`. Critically, the `Log.i` instruction logs a string, which constitutes a real sink for potentially tainted data. The string 'DroidBench' is passed to the log, indicating a possible origin of sensitive data.
