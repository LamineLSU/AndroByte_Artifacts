        "Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The `onCreate` method of `MainActivity` first calls `getSystemService` to obtain a `TelephonyManager` instance. Then, it iteratively adds several phone numbers (+49 123456, +49 654321, +49 111111, +49 222222, +49 333333) to a `HashSet`. Finally, it calls `sendSMS` with the populated `HashSet` and a string argument. The `sendSMS` method is the sink. The key flow is `TelephonyManager.getDeviceId()` which returns a string. This string is passed as an argument to `sendSMS`.  Specifically, instruction `invoke-virtual v6, v5, Lde/ecspride/MainActivity;->sendSMS(Ljava/util/Set; Ljava/lang/String;)V` shows the flow. The `getDeviceId` instruction is the source. The `sendSMS` method is the sink. The `v5` register contains the string returned by `getDeviceId`."
