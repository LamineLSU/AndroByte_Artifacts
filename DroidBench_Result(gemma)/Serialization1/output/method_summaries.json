        "Ledu/mit/serialization/MainActivity;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V": "The method `onCreate` first calls `System.getSystemService` which returns a `TelephonyManager` instance. This instance then calls `getDeviceId()`, which returns a `String`. This `String` is then used to construct an `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream`, indicating serialization and deserialization.  The `getDeviceId()` call is the source of the sensitive data. The `Log.i` call is a sink, but it does not constitute a leak because the `getDeviceId()` call directly provides the argument to the sink. The flow is: `[TelephonyManager->getDeviceId() -> String -> Log.i]`."
