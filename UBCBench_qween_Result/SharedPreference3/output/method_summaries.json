Specifically, it calls `getDeviceId()` on an `android.telephony.TelephonyManager` to obtain the device ID, which is then stored in the `globalImei` instance field of the `MainActivity` class.  It also registers a listener for shared preferences changes and stores a string value in the shared preferences. No sinks are identified in this method."
