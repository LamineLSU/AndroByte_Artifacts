Source methods with sensitive calls: ['Lde/ecspride/TestReceiver;->onReceive:(Landroid/content/Context; Landroid/content/Intent;)V']
[SUMMARY] Lde/ecspride/TestReceiver;->onReceive:(Landroid/content/Context; Landroid/content/Intent;)V => The method retrieves the device ID (IMEI/MEID) via TelephonyManager.getDeviceId() but does not use it. It attempts to send an SMS to a fixed number (+49 1234) with incomplete parameters, but the message content is not set. No sensitive data is definitively passed to a real sink.
