However, this value is later overwritten with an empty string. The sendTextMessage method (SmsManager) is invoked, which constitutes a network transmission sink. The data sent includes a hardcoded phone number as the destination address, but the message content is an empty string. The device ID is not passed to the sink due to being overwritten."
