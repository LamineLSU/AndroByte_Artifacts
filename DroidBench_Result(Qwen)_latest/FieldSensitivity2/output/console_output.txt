Processed summary for Lde/ecspride/FieldSensitivity2;->onCreate:(Landroid/os/Bundle;)V: {
    "Summary": "The method retrieves the SIM serial number via getSystemService and getSimSerialNumber, storing it in a Datacontainer object. The SIM serial number is not passed to any sink. The sendTextMessage method (part of android.telephony) is called but does not transmit sensitive data as it uses hardcoded values. No sink for user data is identified.",
